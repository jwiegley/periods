@anchor{Function fixed-time}
@deffn {Function} fixed-time &rest args
@findex fixed-time
Return a fixed point in time relative to the time of the call.  @code{args} is a
property list giving a specific precision for the return value.

If the keyword argument @code{:now} is given, all else is ignored; this is
equivalent to calling @code{local-time:now}.

Otherwise, any keyword arguments given override their corresponding elements
in the current time.  Further, any elements smaller in resolution than the
finest specified element are reduced to 0 or 1, according to their position.

For example, assuming the current time is "@@2007-11-17T23:02:00.000",
compare these outputs:

@lisp
(fixed-time :month 4) ⇒ @@2007-04-01T00:00:00.000
(fixed-time :day 10)  ⇒ @@2007-11-10T00:00:00.000
(fixed-time :hour 15) ⇒ @@2007-11-17T15:00:00.000
@end lisp

This behavior makes it very easy to return a fixed time for "april of this
year", etc.  If you wish to determine the date of the previous April, while
preserving the current day of the month, hour of the day, etc., then see the
function @code{previous-time}.
