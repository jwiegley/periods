@anchor{Macro do-times}
@deffn {Macro} do-times (var start duration end &optional result) &body body
@findex do-times
Evaluate body where @code{var} is bound to a time starting at @code{start} @code{+} @code{duration}, separated by @code{duration}, until and excluding @code{end}.

A 'do' style version of the functional @code{map-times} macro.

The disadvantage to @code{do-times} is that there is no way to ask for a reversed
time sequence, or specify an inclusive endpoint.

Return @code{nil}.

Example:

@lisp
;; when now is @@2023-11-14T09:05:00
(do-times (time (now)
              (duration :hours 1)
              (next-day))
  (print time))
