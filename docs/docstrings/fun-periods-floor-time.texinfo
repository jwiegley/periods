@deffn {Function} floor-time fixed-time &optional resolution
@findex floor-time
Reduce a fixed time to be no finer than @code{resolution}.

For example, if the date is 2007-04-20, and the resolution is :month, the
date is floored to 2007-04-01.  Anything smaller than the resolution is
reduced to zero (or 1, if it is a day or month being reduced).
