  "Return a fixed point in time relative to the time of the call.  ARGS is a
property list giving a specific precision for the return value.

  If the keyword argument :NOW is given, all else is ignored; this is
equivalent to calling LOCAL-TIME:NOW.

  Otherwise, any keyword arguments given override their corresponding elements
in the current time.  Further, any elements smaller in resolution than the
finest specified element are reduced to 0 or 1, according to their position.

  For example, assuming the current time is \"@2007-11-17T23:02:00.000\",
compare these outputs:

  (fixed-time :month 4) => @2007-04-01T00:00:00.000
  (fixed-time :day 10)  => @2007-11-10T00:00:00.000
  (fixed-time :hour 15) => @2007-11-17T15:00:00.000

This behavior makes it very easy to return a fixed time for \"april of this
year\", etc.  If you wish to determine the date of the previous April, while
preserving the current day of the month, hour of the day, etc., then see the
function PREVIOUS-TIME."

  "Compute the duration existing between fixed-times LEFT and RIGHT.

  The order of left or right is ignored; the returned DURATION, if added to
the earlier value, will result in the later.

  A complexity of this process which might surprise some is that larger
quantities are added by ADD-TIME before smaller quantities.  For example, what
is the difference between 2003-02-10 and 2004-03-01?  If you add years before
days, the difference is 1 year and 20 days.  If you were to add days before
years, however, the difference would be 1 year and 21 days.  The question, do
you advance to 2004 and then calculate between 2-10 and 3-01, or do you move
from 2-10 to 3-01, and then increment the year?  This library chooses to add
years before days, since this follows human reckoning a bit closer (i.e., a
person would likely flip to the 2004 calendar and then start counting off
days, rather than the other way around).  This difference in reckoning can be
tricky, however, so bear this in mind."

  "Compute the first time after FIXED-TIME which matches RELATIVE-TIME.

  This function finds the first moment after FIXED-TIME which honors every
element in RELATIVE-TIME:

  (next-time @2007-05-20 (relative-time :month 3)) => @2008-03-20

  The relative time constructor arguments may also be symbolic:

  (relative-time :month :this)
  (relative-time :month :next)
  (relative-time :month :prev)

  To find the date two weeks after next February, a combination of NEXT-TIME
and ADD-TIME must be used, since \"next February\" is a relative time concept,
while \"two weeks\" is a duration concept:

  (add-time (next-time @2007-05-20 (relative-time :month 2))
            (duration :days 14))

NOTE: The keyword arguments to RELATIVE-TIME are always singular; those to
DURATION are always plural.

  The following form resolves to the first sunday of the given year:

  (next-time (previous-time @2007-05-20 
                            (relative-time :month 1 :day 1))
             (relative-time :week-day 0))

  This form finds the first Friday the 13th after today:

  (next-time @2007-05-20 (relative-time :day 13 :day-of-week 5))

NOTE: When adding times, NEXT-TIME always seeks the next time that fully
honors your request.  If asked for Feb 29, the year of the resulting time will
fall in a leap year.  If asked for Thu, Apr 29, it returns the next occurrence
of Apr 29 which falls on a Friday.  Example:

  (next-time @2007-11-01
             (relative-time :month 4 :day 29 :day-of-week 4))
